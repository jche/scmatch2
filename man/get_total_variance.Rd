\title{Calculate the total variance estimator (V)}
\usage{
get_total_variance(
  matches,
  outcome = "Y",
  treatment = "Z",
  var_weight_type = "ess_units"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{matches}{The CSM match object, an R S3 object}

\item{outcome}{Name of the outcome variable (default "Y")}

\item{treatment}{Name of the treatment variable (default "Z")}

\item{var_weight_type}{The way that cluster variances are averaged:
"num_units": weight by number of units in the subclass
"ess_units": weight by effective sample size of units in the subclass
"uniform": weight each cluster equally}
}
\value{
A tibble with total variance (V), measurement error variance (V_E),
population heterogeneity variance (V_P), and other relevant statistics
}
\description{
Implements the total variance estimator from the paper, which accounts for
both measurement error variance (V_E) and population heterogeneity variance (V_P).
