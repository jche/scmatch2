\title{Distance of kth neighbor plot}
\usage{
caliper_distance_plot(
  scm,
  tops = 1:3,
  caliper = NULL,
  target_percentile = NULL,
  target_k = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{scm}{A csm_matches object}

\item{tops}{A vector of integers indicating which nearest neighbors
to plot}

\item{caliper}{Optional caliper value to plot as a vertical line.
Otherwise it will take caliper from scm object.  If NA will plot
no line.}

\item{target_percentile}{Optional target percentile for caliper,
which will calculate caliper to achieve.}
}
\value{
The plot with some extra attributes.  First is "distances",
the table of distances to the kth nearest neighbor. Second, if
caliper provided, "table" with the table of proportion of
distances below the caliper for each k.  Last is "caliper", the
caliper value used.
}
\description{
Plot distribution of distances between treated units and their
kth-nearest neighbors in the control group, for a set of k values.
