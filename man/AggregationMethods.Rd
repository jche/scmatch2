\usage{
agg_sc_units(
  scweights,
  covariates = get_x_vars(scweights),
  treatment = "Z",
  outcome = NULL
)

agg_co_units(
  scweights,
  covariates = get_x_vars(scweights),

)

}
\arguments{
\item{scweights}{Either a \code{csm_matches} object or a list/data frame
of matching/synthetic-control weights where each subclass
contains one treated row and its controls.}

\item{covariates}{Character vector of covariate names. Defaults to
\code{get_x_vars(scweights)}.}

\item{treatment}{Name of the treatment indicator column.}

\item{outcome}{Name of the outcome column.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with aggregated treated and control
summaries.
}
\description{
These functions aggregate matched or
synthetic-control–style output into unit-level summaries.
}
\details{
\strong{\code{agg_sc_units()}}
Aggregate weights within treated-unit subclass to make pairs of tx
and corresponding synthetic control units. Generally aggregate by
cluster defined by treated unit, calculating the weighted average
of the control units in the cluster for all covariates any any
provided outcomes

\strong{\code{agg_co_units()}}
Aggregates across control units, collecting repeated controls used
across treated units and summing their weights.

\strong{\code{agg_avg_units()}}
Computes simple averages of controls within each subclass
(CEM-style averaging).
