\title{Estimate the measurement error variance component (V_E)}
\usage{
get_measurement_error_variance(
  matches_table,
  outcome = "Y",
  treatment = "Z",
  var_weight_type = "ess_units"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{matches_table}{The data frame of the matched table}

\item{outcome}{Name of the outcome variable (default "Y")}

\item{treatment}{Name of the treatment variable (default "Z")}

\item{var_weight_type}{The way that cluster variances are averaged:
"num_units": weight by number of units in the subclass
"ess_units": weight by effective sample size of units in the subclass
"uniform": weight each cluster equally}
}
\value{
A tibble with measurement error variance (V_E), sigma_hat, N_T, and ESS_C
}
\description{
Calculates the measurement error variance component using the pooled variance
approach described in the paper. This estimates the variance component
due to the noise in outcomes.
