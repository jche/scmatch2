\title{Calculate distances from treated units to their controls}
\usage{
distance_density_plot(scm, feasible_only = FALSE, boxplot_style = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{scm}{A csm_matches object}

\item{feasible_only}{If TRUE, only plot distances for treated units
that were feasible and matched.}

\item{boxplot_style}{If TRUE, use boxplot style for the density
plot.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object showing the density of distances. Also has
two attributes: "table" with summary statistics of the distances,
and "dist_table" with the full table of distances.
}
\description{
Look at distribution of pairwise distances between treated unit and
their synthetic control, average control, and 1-NN control.
