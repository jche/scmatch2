\title{Compute Pairwise Shared Controls}
\usage{
compute_pairwise_shared_controls(matched_matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{matched_matrix}{A matrix where rows are treated units and
columns contain control IDs}
}
\value{
A symmetric matrix where entry i,j is the count of shared
controls between treated units i and j
}
\description{
Computes the number of shared control neighbors between each pair
of treated units based on a given matched matrix. This creates a
pairwise comparison matrix.
