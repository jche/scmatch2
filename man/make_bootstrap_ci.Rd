\title{Create a bootstrap confidence interval calculator factory}
\usage{
make_bootstrap_ci(boot_mtd, use_moving_block = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{boot_mtd}{The bootstrap method to use. Must be one of:
\itemize{
\item "Bayesian" - Uses Dirichlet distribution for weights
\item "wild" - Uses wild bootstrap with Mammen weights
\item "naive-resid" - Uses naive residual resampling
}}

\item{use_moving_block}{Logical flag to determine if Moving Block Bootstrap should be applied.}

\item{resids}{Numeric vector of residuals to bootstrap}

\item{mean_est}{Point estimate around which to construct intervals}

\item{B}{Number of bootstrap iterations}

\item{block_size}{Size of blocks for moving block bootstrap (only used if use_moving_block is TRUE)}

\item{seed_addition}{Value added to base seed for reproducibility}
}
\value{
A function that computes confidence intervals and standard errors with parameters:
\itemize{
\item resids - Numeric vector of residuals to bootstrap
\item mean_est - Point estimate (typically mean) around which to construct intervals
\item B - Number of bootstrap iterations
\item block_size - Size of blocks for moving block bootstrap (only required if use_moving_block is TRUE)
\item seed_addition - Value added to base seed for reproducibility (default: 123)
}

A list containing:
\itemize{
\item ci_lower - Lower bound of confidence interval
\item ci_upper - Upper bound of confidence interval
\item sd - Bootstrap standard error
}

List containing ci_lower, ci_upper, and sd
}
\description{
Creates a specialized function for computing confidence intervals and standard errors
from bootstrap samples using various resampling methods.

\examples{
# Create bootstrap CI calculator
bayesian_ci <- make_bootstrap_ci("Bayesian", use_moving_block = TRUE)

# Generate example data
resids <- rnorm(100)
mean_est <- mean(resids)

# Calculate CIs and SE
results <- bayesian_ci(resids, mean_est, B = 1000, block_size = 5)
print(c(results$ci_lower, results$ci_upper, results$sd))
