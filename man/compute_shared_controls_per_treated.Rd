\title{Compute Shared Controls Per Treated}
\usage{
compute_shared_controls_per_treated(matched_matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{matched_matrix}{A matrix where rows are treated units and
columns contain control IDs}
}
\value{
A list containing: \item{mean_shared}{Mean number of shared
controls per treated unit} \item{median_shared}{Median number of
shared controls per treated unit} \item{prop_shared}{Mean
proportion of controls that are shared} \item{max_shared}{Maximum
number of shared controls for any treated unit}
\item{shared_per_treated}{Vector of shared control counts for
each treated unit}
}
\description{
For each treated unit, calculates how many of its matched controls
are shared with at least one other treated unit. This metric ranges
from 0 (no sharing) to k (all k matched controls are shared), where
k is the number of matches per treated unit.
