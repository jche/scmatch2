\usage{
get_cal_matches(
  df,
  form = NULL,
  covs = NULL,
  treatment = NULL,
  metric = c("maximum", "euclidean", "manhattan"),
  caliper = 1,
  rad_method = c("adaptive", "fixed", "1nn", "adaptive-5nn", "knn"),
  est_method = c("scm", "scm_extrap", "average"),
  scaling = NULL,
  id_name = "id",
  warn = TRUE,
  k = 5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{The data frame of data to be matched. Must contain
treatment indicator and covariates for matching.}

\item{form}{Formula of form treatment ~ cov1 + cov2 + ...
specifying the treatment variable and covariates to use for
matching.  If not null, will override covs and treatment.}

\item{covs}{Specification of covariates to use for matching. Can be
variable names, list of column numbers, or NULL.  If NULL, will
use covariate names found in the scaling parameter, or default to
all columns starting with "X".}

\item{treatment}{Name of the column in \code{df} containing the
treatment indicator (with values 0/1 or TRUE/FALSE).}

\item{metric}{A string specifying the distance metric. One of
"maximum", "euclidean", or "manhattan".}

\item{caliper}{A numeric specifying the caliper size for matching.
Controls the maximum allowable distance between matched units.}

\item{rad_method}{Method to determine the radius size for each
treated unit. Options include:
\itemize{
\item "adaptive": Uses the maximum of the caliper and the distance to nearest control
\item "fixed": Uses the specified caliper value
\item "1nn": Uses the distance to the nearest neighbor
\item "adaptive-5nn": Adaptive radius with cap at 5th nearest neighbor
\item "knn": Uses the distance to the kth nearest neighbor
}}

\item{est_method}{Method for estimating weights for control units.
Options include:
\itemize{
\item "scm": Synthetic control method weighting
\item "scm_extrap": Synthetic control with extrapolation
\item "average": Simple average weighting
}}

\item{scaling}{A vector of scaling constants for covariates (can
also be a single row data frame). These are often just the
inverses of covariate-specific standard deviations. Controls the
relative importance of different covariates in the distance
calculation.  If covs not supplied, will use name of this
parameter to identify covariates.}

\item{id_name}{Name of column to look for ID values. If that column
is not found, a canonical \code{id} corresponding to row numbers
will be created.}

\item{warn}{A logical indicating whether to warn about dropped
units (those that cannot be matched within the caliper).}

\item{k}{Integer specifying the number of neighbors to use when
\code{rad_method = "knn"}.}
}
\value{
An S3 object of class "csm_matches" containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{matches}: A list of data frames, each containing matched control units for a treated unit
\item \code{adacalipers}: Vector of adaptive calipers for each treated unit
\item \code{dm_trimmed}: Distance matrix with control units farther than caliper set to NA
\item \code{dm_uncapped}: Original distance matrix without censoring
\item \code{treatment_table}: Table of treated units with matching information
}
The object also has attributes storing the settings used for
matching.
}
\description{
This is the core method of the CSM package. Conduct (adaptive)
radius matching with optional synthetic step on the resulting sets
of controls. The function creates a matched dataset by finding
control units that are similar to treatment units based on
specified covariates and distance metrics, then optionally weights
these controls using synthetic control methods.
