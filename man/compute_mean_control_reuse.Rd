\title{Compute Mean Control Reuse}
\usage{
compute_mean_control_reuse(matched_matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{matched_matrix}{A matrix where rows are treated units and
columns contain control IDs}
}
\value{
A list containing: \item{mean_reuse}{Mean number of times a
control is matched} \item{median_reuse}{Median number of times a
control is matched} \item{max_reuse}{Maximum number of times a
control is matched} \item{control_reuse_counts}{Named vector of
reuse counts for each control}
}
\description{
Calculates the mean of K(j), where K(j) is the number of times each
control is matched to a treated unit. This metric ranges from 1 (no
reuse) to n_T (all controls used by all treated).
